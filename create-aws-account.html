      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Opening Up AWS</h3>
      <p>Start by opening your web browser and going to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Tier page</a>. It's like unlocking the door to your cloud adventure.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Creating Your Account</h3>
      <p>Hit that "Create a Free Account" button in the middle of the page. It's like saying "Let's do this!" to AWS.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Your Account Details</h3>
      <p>Here's where you tell AWS who you are. Fill in your email address (make sure it's not already used for Amazon AWS), create a password, and give your account a name. This is like giving your account a cool nickname. After that, you will get a verification code in your email which you have provided.</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Contact Info</h3>
      <p>Let AWS know if you're going for a personal or professional account. Fill in your info, agree to the rules, and hit "Create Account." Just make sure your phone number and email are right, so you can get a secret code later.</p>

      <h3>Step 5: Payment Info</h3>
      <p>Don't worry, you won't be charged right away. This is just to verify you're a real person. Put in your credit or debit card info and billing address, and click "Secure Submit."</p>

      <h3>Step 6: Payment Validation</h3>
      <p>AWS will do a quick test charge, but it's just a tiny amount. It's like checking to see if your card works. They charged me 2 INR (Indian Rupees).</p>

      <h3>Step 7: Phone Check</h3>
      <p>AWS will send you a code to your phone. You can choose to get it as a text message or a phone call. Type in the code and hit "Verify Code."</p>
