      <h3>How to create an AWS FREE Tier Account with step-by-step instructions.</h3>

      <h3>Question: Why Free Tier?</h3>
      <p><b>Ans:</b>The AWS Free Tier allows customers to explore and try out AWS services free of charge up to specified limits for each service. The Free Tier consists of three different types of offerings, 12 months free, always free, and short-term free trials. You can also learn more from AWS Free Tier FAQs.

      <p><b>Step 2:</b>After clicking on the link, you will be directed straight to the official AWS Free Tier webpage (Figure 1.2: AWS Free Tier).</p>

      <h3>Entering Your Account Details: Providing essential information and verifying your email address.</h3>

      <p>Once you click on that button, you will be prompted to enter your basic details, including your root user email address and a unique AWS account name.</p>

      <h3>Question: What is the root user?</h3>
      <p><b>Ans:</b> When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is the AWS account root user. You can sign in as the root user using the email address and password that you used to create the account. Read more about root users here.</p>
      <p>Enter the active email with which you want to create an AWS account.</p>
      
      <p><b>Step 4:</b>Fill the required information.</p>
      <p>Now confirm the verification code sent to the email address and click verify (Figure 1.4: Confirm the Verification code).</p>

      <h3>Setting Up Payment Information: Inputting your credit or debit card details for account verification.</h3>
      <p><b>Step 7:</b> The next step is to provide a credit card for billing your AWS account.  It recommended  that your debit card has at least $1 in it so that AWS can use it for verification.</p>
      <p>You can also create a virtual card and you should have at least $1 in It. Don’t panic, your money will not be deducted but note that your registration will fail if you don’t have the amount there. Once you’re done, click Verify and continue (Figure 1.7: Billing Information).</p>
